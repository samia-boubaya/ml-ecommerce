    "## 1. 📌 Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to explore the **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset** to understand user behavior during online shopping sessions and identify factors that influence purchase decisions (`Revenue`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains **12_330 user sessions** with **18 features** describing session behavior and contextual information. The target variable `Revenue` indicates whether a purchase was made (`True` = '1') or not (`False`= '0').\n",

    "### 4.2 Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Majority of users are **Returning Visitors**.\n",
    "- Most traffic occurs in specific months (e.g., May, November).\n",
    "- Most sessions occur on weekdays rather than weekends.\n",
    "- Some browsers and operating systems dominate traffic.\n",

    "### Class Distribution (Binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximately 84–85% of sessions result in **no purchase**.\n",
    "- Approximately 15–16% result in **purchase**.\n",

    "- `ProductRelated_Duration` is significantly higher for sessions that ended in purchase.\n",
    "- `PageValues` is strongly associated with purchases.\n",
    "- Lower `BounceRates` and `ExitRates` are associated with higher purchase probability.\n",
    "- `SpecialDay` does not show a strong influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Categorical Features vs Revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returning visitors are more likely to purchase.\n",
    "- Purchases tend to increase in certain months.\n",
    "- Weekend effect appears moderate.\n",
    "- Traffic source may influence purchase likelihood.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. 📌 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product engagement is the strongest indicator of purchase.**\n",
    "2. **Higher session duration increases purchase probability.**\n",
    "3. **Lower bounce and exit rates are associated with conversion.**\n",
    "4. **Returning visitors are more likely to convert.**\n",
    "5. The dataset is imbalanced and requires appropriate handling in predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE or class weighting).\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables.\n",
    "- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).\n",
    "- Evaluate using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDA reveals that user engagement metrics, particularly related to product pages and session behavior, are strong predictors of purchasing intention. These insights can help businesses optimize user experience and improve conversion rates.\n"
